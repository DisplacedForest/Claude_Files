## üîß Technical Specification

### Architecture Overview
```
[Include simple ASCII diagram or description of how this fits into existing system]
```

### Database Changes
```sql
-- New tables (if any)
CREATE TABLE new_feature_table (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);

-- New columns (if any)
ALTER TABLE existing_table ADD COLUMN new_field text;

-- New indexes (if any)
CREATE INDEX idx_feature_lookup ON new_feature_table(user_id, created_at);
```

### API Changes

#### New Endpoints
```typescript
// GET /api/feature/:id - Get feature details
interface FeatureResponse {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive';
  createdAt: Date;
}

// POST /api/feature - Create new feature
interface CreateFeatureRequest {
  name: string;
  configuration: FeatureConfig;
}
```

#### Modified Endpoints
- **GET /api/users/:id**: Add new `featureSettings` field to response
- **PUT /api/settings**: Accept new feature configuration options

### Frontend Changes

#### New Components
- `FeatureToggle`: Toggle feature on/off
